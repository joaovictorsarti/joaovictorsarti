### Another guy who write and love code. :octocat:

My name is João Victor Sarti (:brazil:). Computer Science undergraduate student at Pontifícia Universidade Católica of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas).
I am passionate about development, but I also like to create useless things :joy:. 

I am currently a beginner programmer, but I intend to contribute to projects and also to the open-source community in the future to later enter my career as a developer, for that I need to study hard and practice and that is why I am here.
