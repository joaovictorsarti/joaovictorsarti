### Another guy who write and love code. ğŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Victor Sarti (:brazil:). Currently Computer Science undergraduate student at PontifÃ­cia Universidade CatÃ³lica of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas).
I am passionate about development, but I also like to create useless things :joy:. I enjoy reading and understanding about hacking.
